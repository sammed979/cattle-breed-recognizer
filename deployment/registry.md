# Dataset and Model Registry

## Purpose
Maintain a versioned registry for all datasets and models to ensure reproducibility and traceability.

## Structure
- Each dataset and model version is assigned a unique ID and timestamp
- Metadata includes source, annotation details, augmentation methods, and performance metrics
- Registry is stored as a CSV or database table

## Example Entry
| Version | Type    | ID         | Timestamp   | Source      | Metrics         |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| v1.0    | Model   | 20240601   | 2024-06-01  | initial     | acc:0.85, prec:0.83 |
| v1.0    | Dataset | 20240601   | 2024-06-01  | crowdsourced| 10,000 images   |

## Maintenance
- Update registry with each new release
- Archive old versions for rollback
- Automate registry updates via deployment scripts
